# RL_Individual_assignment

This repository contains the implementation of reinforcement learning agents applied to the Flappy Bird environment.

## Contents

- **Individual assignment.ipynb**  
  This is the main Jupyter notebook. It includes:
  - Implementation of two RL agents: **Monte Carlo Control** and **True Online Sarsa**
  - Training processes and plots of rewards
  - Visualizations of the learned state value functions

- **text_flappy_bird_env_screen.py**  
- **text_flappy_bird_env_simple.py**  
- **text_flappy_bird_logic.py**
  
These Python files define the **Flappy Bird game logic and environments** used for training the agents.  
  - `text_flappy_bird_logic.py`: Core game mechanics
  - `text_flappy_bird_env_simple.py`: A simplified version of the environment
  - `text_flappy_bird_env_screen.py`: An environment that includes screen-rendering logic
